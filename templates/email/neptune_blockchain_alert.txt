Event: Neptune Blockchain Height Monitor Status Change.

Event Time: {{self.now.to_rfc3339()}}

Event Description:

%% if matches!(self.blockchain_state, BlockchainState::Normal) {
The present block height is greater than the height at last check.  Service is restored.
%% } else if self.last_height == self.height {
The present block height is equal to the height at last check.
This may indicate a problem with neptune-core.
%% } else {
The present block height is less than the height at last check.
This may indicate a problem with neptune-core.
%% }

New Status:
    blockchain monitor: {{self.blockchain_state}}
    last_height: {{self.last_height}}
    height: {{self.height}}
    Now: {{self.now.to_rfc3339()}}

Previous Status:
    blockchain monitor: {{self.last_blockchain_state}}
    Since: {{self.since.to_rfc3339()}}
    Duration: {{self.duration}}

Recommended action:

%% if matches!(self.blockchain_state, BlockchainState::Normal) {
    Check neptune-core logs to ensure it is operating correctly.

    No further corrective action should be necessary.
%% } else {
    If only one hour has passed since the last block:

        1. It is possible/likely that a block simply has not been found yet.
        2. Check neptune-core logs to ensure it is operating correctly.
        3. Check other nodes to ensure they are at the same block height.

    if two or more hours have passed since the last block:
        1. Check neptune-core logs to ensure it is operating correctly.
        2. Check other nodes to ensure they are at the same block height.
        3. Consider restarting neptune-core
        4. Consider filing an issue, or alerting neptune-core developers.
